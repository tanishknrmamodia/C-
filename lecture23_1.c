/*
array in c :
array is collection of data items of the same types 
items are stored at contiguous memory location 

1-d array is like a list
2-d array is like a table

why do we need array ?
code that use arrays is sometimes more organized and readable

advantages of array
it is used to represent multiple data items of same type by using only single name
2-d array is used to represtn matrix 

properties:
data in array is stored in contiguous memory location 
each element of an array is of same size

syntax for declaring and initializing an array

data_type name[size];
data_type name[size]={x,y,z,.....}. size not required in this case
for example : 
int marks [200]
marks[0]=100; 
marks[1]=96; 

data_type name[rows][colums];   for 2-d array

and information on array is this now we will code


disadvantages of array

poor time complexity and deletion operation
wastage of memory since arrays are fixed in size
it is not possible to increase the size of array , once your have declared the array
